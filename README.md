Tools Used:
SQL for data extraction and manipulation.
Power BI for data visualization.

Project Steps:

1. Data Extraction and Preparation using SQL:
   Connect to your SQL database.
   Load the customer dataset.
   Explore the dataset to understand its structure and variables.
   Preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.

2. Customer Churn Calculation:
   Define a churn metric, such as customers who haven't made a purchase in the last 90 days as churned.
   Create SQL queries to identify churned customers.

3. Feature Engineering:
   Create relevant features, such as customer tenure, average purchase amount, and customer segment.
   Calculate metrics that may be indicative of churn, like customer activity frequency.

4. Churn Analysis:
Use SQL to perform churn analysis, including:
Churn rate calculation.
Segmentation to identify high-risk customer groups.

5. Data Visualization with Power BI:
Connect Power BI to your SQL database.
Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize your churn analysis results.
Use Power BI's visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, heatmaps) to display churn trends, cohort analysis, and segmentation results.
Implement slicers and filters to allow for dynamic exploration of the data.

6. Insights and Recommendations:
Share your findings from the analysis.
Provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn based on your analysis results.
Visualize the impact of potential strategies using Power BI.

Conclusion: This customer churn analysis project demonstrates the power of SQL and Power BI in extracting insights from data and making informed business decisions. By understanding the factors contributing to churn and visualizing the data effectively, organizations can take proactive steps to retain customers and drive business growth.
